## 🤖 PR Review Checklist

---

### 1️⃣ Scope & Intent (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- [ ] PR matches the ticket **exactly**
- [ ] No features added beyond ticket scope
- [ ] No “helpful extras” added by AI
- [ ] No silent behavior changes
- [ ] No TODOs that hide unfinished logic

🚫 If scope creep is detected → **Request Changes**

---

### 2️⃣ Assumption Detection (CRITICAL)

- [ ] No inferred business rules
- [ ] No guessed validation logic
- [ ] No hardcoded limits unless explicitly required
- [ ] No assumptions about user roles or permissions
- [ ] No assumptions about future requirements

🚫 Any unstated assumption → **Request Changes**

---

### 3️⃣ Architecture & Responsibility

- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] No god components / god services
- [ ] No logic dumped into UI components
- [ ] No duplication across layers
- [ ] Code fits existing project patterns

🚫 Structural deviation → **Request Changes**

---

### 4️⃣ Behavior Verification (NOT VISUAL ONLY)

- [ ] Feature works as described
- [ ] Edge cases explicitly handled or explicitly ignored
- [ ] Error states handled intentionally
- [ ] No hidden side effects
- [ ] No reliance on undefined behavior

🚫 Undefined behavior → **Request Changes**

---

### 5️⃣ UI / UX (if applicable)

- [ ] UI behavior matches expected flow (not just design)
- [ ] Interactions behave consistently
- [ ] Hover / click / drag priorities respected
- [ ] Responsive behavior verified
- [ ] No layout hacks or magic numbers

🚫 UI “looks right but behaves wrong” → **Reject**

---

### 6️⃣ Code Quality (AI-Specific)

- [ ] No unnecessary abstractions
- [ ] No over-generalization
- [ ] No unused code or dead paths
- [ ] No excessive comments explaining obvious code
- [ ] No copy-pasted patterns without need

🚫 Over-engineering → **Request Simplification**

---

### 7️⃣ Hardcoded Values & Config

- [ ] No magic numbers without justification
- [ ] No environment-specific values hardcoded
- [ ] No inline configuration that should be centralized

🚫 Hardcoded behavior → **Request Changes**

---

### 8️⃣ Tests (AI MUST be Proven)

- [ ] Tests added or updated
- [ ] Tests actually validate behavior (not just coverage)
- [ ] Edge cases covered where risk exists
- [ ] No meaningless snapshot tests

🚫 No tests for risky logic → **Reject**

---

### 9️⃣ Git Hygiene (MANDATORY)

- [ ] Branch name follows convention
- [ ] Commit messages follow ticket format
- [ ] Commits are small and logical
- [ ] No unrelated formatting changes
- [ ] No generated files committed accidentally

🚫 Git hygiene issues → **Request Cleanup**

---

### 🔟 Safety & Maintainability

- [ ] Code can be understood by a human in 6 months
- [ ] No “AI cleverness”
- [ ] No fragile logic
- [ ] No tight coupling to implementation details

🚫 Fragile or opaque code → **Request Refactor**

---

## ✅ Final Decision (Choose One)

- [ ] **Approved**
- [ ] **Approved with minor comments**
- [ ] **Changes requested**
- [ ] **Rejected (unsafe or incorrect)**

---

## 🛑 AI Review Rule (Read This)

> If you cannot explain **why** a line of code exists,  
> it does not belong in the codebase.

AI-generated code must be **provably correct**, not just plausible.
